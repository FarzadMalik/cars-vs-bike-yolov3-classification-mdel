## Description

This project involves the classification of images into two classes: "car" and "bike." A deep learning model is trained on the provided dataset to perform the classification.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Car vs Bike Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshsaxenadn/car-vs-bike-classification-dataset). It contains a collection of images of cars and bikes, which are divided into training and testing sets. The dataset is organized into separate folders for each class.

## Dependencies

List the external libraries and packages required to run your project. You can reference the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

Explain how to install your project, including any setup steps that might be needed.

## Usage

Provide instructions on how to use your project, including code examples and explanations.

## Training

To train the classification model on the Car vs Bike dataset, follow these steps:

1. Download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utkarshsaxenadn/car-vs-bike-classification-dataset).
2. Extract the dataset and organize it into separate folders for training and testing.
3. Run the training script provided in the Jupyter Notebook: `car_vs_bike_simplified_yolov3_classification_model.ipynb`.
4. Monitor the training progress and evaluate the model's performance.

You can also download the pre-trained model weights: `car_vs_bike_yolov3.pth`.

## Inference

After training, you can use the trained model for inference on new images. Provide code examples and instructions on how to load the model and perform inference.
